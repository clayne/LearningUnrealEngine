# Learning Unreal Engine


This repository is more or less on pause while I evaluate another note taking style.
Those notes are in the [LearningUnreal](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningUnreal) GitHub repository.
If you found these notes useful then perhaps you will find something interesting there as well.


This is a collection of notes that I write while learning how to use Unreal Engine.
They are incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and meant more for recollection than instruction.
You are not the target audience, I am.
If you want to learn about Unreal Engine then I suggest you look into the resources listed below.
Many of the pages also include links to the various sources I used when researching the topic for that page.
Still, the notes are made public with the hope that they will be useful.
If you find lies or falsehoods in the notes then I would appreciate [an issue](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningUnrealEngine/issues/new).
The intention is that each document should be small, focused, clear, and concise.
That's not always the case, but I'm getting there. Eventually. Maybe.
The texts are not written with the intention of being read top-to-bottom.
The texts are written as collections of statements, each sentence forming a stand-alone factoid.
Still, related factoids are written together and in a sane order. Most of the time.
The texts are written in Markdown but are best read in a text editor with Markdown highlighting rather than a full-fledged Markdown renderer.
This is because line breaks are used as separators but Markdown renderers ignore them.
Many of the documents contain links to the sources.
There is no prescribed or implied order to the documents, just read what you find interesting.
Some lines are written within parenthesis and in _italics_.
(
_Like this._
)
This signals that there is something that I don't understand.

Some documents are different from the bulk of the documents.
They are marked with `~` followed by a type.

- ~Collection
  A collection of documents about some topic.
  This is not a sort of manual tag listing but a way to cross-connect various
  subject matters that are needed to do what the collection is about.
- ~Tutorial
  Step-by-step instructions for how to do something.
- ~Presentation
  Notes that belong to a particular presentation, usually in the form of a
  YouTube video. Any valuable information present here should also be present
  in the document for that topic.
- ~Trail
  A sequence of documents or document sections that when read in a particular
  order conveys some message or instruction. The ~Trail document form the start
  of a linked list of links.

The material in these notes comes primarily from the following sources,
but a large number of other sources have been used to write particular documents.
See the links in each document.
