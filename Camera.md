# Camera

A `Camera` is often added to a `Pawn` or a `Character`, but sometimes to the level.
Use a `Pawn` for a free-floating camera and `Character` for something that walks around.
A `Camera` is often attached via a `SpringArm`.
The `Pawn` that the `Camera` is attached to should be be the `Default Pawn Class` in the Game mode.

A camera can also be stand-alone.

A camera can also be attached to a socket.
Make the Camera a child of the Mesh.
Select the socket in the Camera's Details Panel > Sockets > Parent Socket.

A Camera that is part of a Pawn can use the Pawn's (Player?) Controller for it's view direction.
To enable, check Camera > Details Panel > Camera Settings > Use Pawn Control Rotation.

A selected Camera can be previewed as a picture-in-picture (PiP) overlay in the main viewport by enabling Edit > Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Look and Feel > Preview Selected Cameras. Disabling it will hide the camera preview.
